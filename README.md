## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT

The power of chatbots is not lost on the business world. As brands focus on promoting personalized experiences, more and more intelligent chatbots are being built to engage users and improve brand image. That said, it is a rarity to find a live intelligent chatbot, also called as AI chatbot. As the thought of a chatbot springs up, we know it is not a real person for sure. What we know is that these chatbots bring a human touch. For that to become a reality, they need to be really intelligent. The crux is not the chatbot, rather it is the intelligence quotient that bring the human touch.

It is the intelligence that gives power to the AI chatbot to learn from conversations and handle any and every situation that comes its way. As chatbots move into complex territories, raising the intelligence quotient becomes increasingly difficult.

Enter the following in your command prompt/terminal:
- Windows: 
    ```launch.bat clean install```
- Linux/Unix: 
    ```./launch.sh clean install```

The projects will take some time to build for the first time as it will be downloading dependencies to your machine.
If you encounter 'unable to access jarfile target' error, run the launch command one more time.

Once the app has finished building and deployed, open up a web browser and enter localhost:8090. If the build was successful and the app was deployed successfully, you will be able to view the application in your web browser.
